Alarm Clock using datetime and tkinter modules

<p>
In this lets see how to develop a basic alarm clock using python. The python libraries that we are going to use to develop this project are  datetime and tkinter. which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.

<u><b>Basic Project Structure:-</b></u>
First, letâ€™s check the steps to build an Alarm Clock program in Python:
1.Importing all the libraries and modules required
2.Putting forward a while loop which takes the argument of the time, the user wants to set the alarm on and automatically breaks when the time is up, with sound
3.Create a display window for user input.
